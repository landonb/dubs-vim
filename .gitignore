# Ignore Session files (Vim's workspace saver): To track application sessions
# between invocations, Vim uses either a ~/.vim/Session.vim file, or multiple
# files under ~/.vim/sessions/<servername>.vim. Dubs uses the latter approach,
# by using vim's --servername option. This has a few benefits, such as making
# Vim development easier, as you can muck with code in one instance, and kill
# and restart another gvim instance to test modifications.

# To develop the complete dubsacks_vim and also the individual
# dubsacks submodules requires a bit of finesse.
#
# The bundle_/ directory contains the individually-cloned
# dubsacks_vim projects (not submoduled) and symlinks to
# the third-party submodules we populated in bundle/.
#
# To see what dubsacks code is dirty, use git_status_all, e.g.,
#
#  cd ~/.vim/bundle_ ; git_st_all
#
# So we can ignore bundle_/.

# Here's a long-winded explanation of the chay-os.
#
# If you want to checkout the dubsacks_vim project and also all of
# the plugins themselves as source and not just as submodules, you
# have to deal with some conflict, since you'll have two copies of
# every plugin (one of the source and one of the submodule). First,
# mkdir ~/.vim/bundle_ and git clone all the plugins therein. Next,
# make a copy of .vimrc, name it bundle/dubs_all/.vimrc.bundle_,
# and infect bundle_/{} rather than bundle/{}. Link it from
# ~/.vimrc. With this setup, ~/.vim/.git is the dubsacks_vim
# repository, ~/.vim/bundle is a ton of submodules from github, and
# ~/.vim/bundle_ is a bunch of git clones of the same submodules
# found in ~/.vim/bundle. That way, Vim will load the real source
# under ~/.vim/bundle_ -- and you'll edit the same source when
# tweaking Vim -- but you're also be able to maintain the ~/.vim/.git
# uber plugin that manages everything as submodules. So you can
# really just ignore everything under ~/.vim/bundle and concentrate
# on ~/.vim/bundle_ instead, except for the ~/.vim/bundle/dubs_all
# directory, which is part of dubsacks_vim (~/.vim/.git). Git it?
