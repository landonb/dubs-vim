# Ignore Session files (Vim's workspace saver): To track application sessions
# between invocations, Vim uses either a ~/.vim/Session.vim file, or multiple
# files under ~/.vim/sessions/<servername>.vim. Dubs uses the latter approach,

# Vim development easier, as you can muck with code in one instance, and kill
# and restart another gvim instance to test modifications.
