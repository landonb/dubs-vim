" Yes, the DTK is an overlay, or a pretty sizable 
" configuration of Vim. No, it's not Cream
" (http://cream.sourceforge.net/); it's not a 
" simplified Vim meant for the masses. You still 
" have to learn Vim, but that means you still get 
" the power of Vim. The DTK is just here so you 
" don't have to go fishing for all the plugins you 
" want (or didn't know you wanted ;), and so all 
" your favorite commands are mapped to your 
" favorite keystrokes. The DTK keeps remapping of 
" existing keystrokes to a minimum -- in other 
" words, you're not re-learning Vim, you're just 
" learning some new commands for Vim (unless, of 
" course, you've already got your own vimrc file 
" and it conflicts with the DTK, in which case 
" it's up to you to fix any conflicts =).
