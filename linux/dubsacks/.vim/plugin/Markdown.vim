" Convert HTML link to Markdown link
" --------------------------------
" E.g.,
"   http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new
" becomes
"   [http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new](http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new)
noremap <Leader>l :let tmp=@/<CR>:s/\(http[s]\?:\/\/[^ \t()\[\]]\+\)/[\1](\1)/ge<CR>:let @/=tmp<CR>
" TODO In Markdown, surround the link in angle 
"      brackets does the same thing, e.g.,
"        <http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new>
"      So maybe \L adds brackets
"      and \l converts to 
"        [](http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new)
"      and puts the cursor in the brackets
"      TODO There's also the [reference][ref-id] format
