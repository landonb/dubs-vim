"  Window-Friendly Buffer Delete

" From http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip165

" Author: Landon Bouma <landonb@retrosoft.com>

" License: What License?

" This script defines :Bclose, which deletes 
" a buffer (actually removes it from the buffer
" list) while retaining the current window 
" layout.

" This file is a modified version of the script 
" detailed at http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip165,
" last updated 2008-11-18.

" ------------------------------------------
" Changelog

" Version 1.0.0 / 2009.09.09 / Landon Bouma
"   Initial release.

" Startup

" if the script has not already been loaded

" By default, allow the user to close a buffer 
" even if it's being viewed in multiple windows.
" The user can :let plugin_bclose_multiple = 0 
" in their Vim startup script to prevent this.

" Command ':Bclose' executes ':bd' to delete buffer in current window.
" The window will show the alternate buffer (Ctrl-^) if it exists,

" An optional argument can specify which buffer to close (name or number).
