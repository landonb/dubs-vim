" ===================================================================

" ------------------------------------------
" About:

" If you want to set any g:global variables to override stock
" Vim script behavior, you have to set the globals *before*
" sourcing the shared Vim files. So the `.vimrc` for Dubsacks
" sources this script before loading any system scripts.

" ------------------------------------------------------------
" Extend the reST syntax highlighter's code vocabulary
" by overriding the ``.. code-block:: <language>`` mapping.
" ------------------------------------------------------------
" SYNC_ME: Similar *.rst changes in dubs_preloads.vim and rst_dubsacks.vim.

" See the Vim package file that takes care of reST syntax highlighting:
"  /usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/rst.vim
" The list of recognized syntax highlighting languages is merely:
"   if !exists('g:rst_syntax_code_list')
"     let g:rst_syntax_code_list = ['vim', 'java', 'cpp', 'lisp',
"                                   'php', 'python', 'perl']
"   endif
" but we can do better than that, eh?
" Each language type is just bouced to another syntax file; see:
"   ls /usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax
" We could add them in ftplugin/rst_dubsacks.vim, but it's
"  a wee bit easier to setup the array that rst.vim uses.
" See also :help initialization for Vim script load ordering;
"  we could maybe set g: whenever and call runtime! to reload
"  the appropriate vim script, but which script is it? It's
"  easier just to swoop in early.

" Note that you cannot add 'rst' to this list without
" causing errors probably due to recursivenosity.
let g:rst_syntax_code_list = [
  \ 'bash',
  \ 'sh',
  \ 'vim',
  \ 'python',
  \ 'java',
  \ 'cpp',

" Re: bash syntax defined by sh.vim, so to make it work
" so you don't have to do, e.g., .. code-block:: sh
" we made a symlink, i.e.,
" ln -s /usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/sh.vim \
"       $HOME/.vim/bundle/dubs_ftype_mess/syntax/bash.vim
