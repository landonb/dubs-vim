# If you've install the master Dubs Vim repo (that contains this .ignore),
# all its submodules install to bundle/. If you then checkout each of the
# Dubsacks plugins so you can develop on them: clone them each under
# bundle_/, and symlink from bundle/ any submodules you did not clone.
# Finally, ban *grep from searching either location.

# The author also sometimes "disables" plugins without deleting them -- to
# test and develop -- by moving the plugin off-path. Ignore this directory.
