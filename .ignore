# If you install the master Dubsacks Vim repo,
# all its submodules install to bundle/. If you
# then clone each of the Dubsacks plugins so you
# can develop on them, check'em out to bundle_,
# and symlink from bundle what you don't care to
# work on. We won't bother searching either place.
bundle/
# Ignore subdirectories, but not the generate_links.sh.
bundle_/*/
# Then, if you want to make a searchable subset of
# what's under bundle_, create a subset of symlinks
# under a third directory!
bundle-dubs/
# The author also sometimes disables plugins without
# deleting them (for testing and developing). Ignore
# this directory, too.
