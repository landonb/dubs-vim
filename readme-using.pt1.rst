About dubs_all Plugin
---------------------

The Dubsacks VIM code is separated into multiple plugins
loosely grouped by functionality so that people can install
subsets of Dubsacks if they want.

But if you want it all, use git to install this plugin,
which includes all Dubsacks plugins as submodules.

Comprehensive Feature List
--------------------------

Each plugin's README.rst is reproduced herein to give a nice,
comprehensive (albeit lengthy) list of all the features.

Most of the features and key mappings are specific to Dubsacks,
but a few commonly-used (or commonly-forgotten) Vim commands are
also included.

Features are grouped into categories and are identified by
their keyboard mapping or ``:command`` name, followed by a
brief description of the feature and then more detailed notes.

.. NOTE: For security reasons, the include directive does not
..       work on github. As such, this following will not work...
..
